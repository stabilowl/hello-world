# Hello-world
My name is William and I am an Engineer interested in the field of AI and Data Science. I have made it a goal in 2020 to step my foot into the field. While I have tried a few years back without any luck, I know I was close to getting my foot in the door, so this time, I am determined to succeed. Then even if I fail at the end, I know I have given my best shot.
